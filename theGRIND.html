  <h1> The Grind </h1>


<div>
<p> The Grind was founded in 1987 by our grandmother, a warm and lively figure who lovingly crafted the menu from scratch. We are a quaint, quiet cafe - the perfect place to curl up on an armchair on a Sunday evening. We offer a full espresso and brew-bar menu as well as fresh breakfast and lunch options. </p>

<p2> Located at the heart of East London, The Grind is a sociable, friendly and up-beat Cafe. We offer a range of catering events, from small parties to large parties. Occasionally, singers are invited here to perform a variety of music such as Jazz and Pop. Just give us a message below if you would like to reserve a table or perform at The Grind and we would get back to you as soon as possible! </p2>
